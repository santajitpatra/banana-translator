Sure! Here's an example readme.md for your "banana translator" web app:

# Banana Translator Web App

Welcome to the Banana Translator web app! This app allows users to translate English phrases into banana language.

## Installation

To use this app, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/santajitpatra/banana-translator
```

Then, open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the app.

## Usage

To translate a phrase into banana language, simply enter the phrase into the input field and click the "Translate" button. The translated text will appear below the input field.

## How it Works

The Banana Translator web app uses a simple algorithm to translate English phrases into banana language. First, it splits the input phrase into individual words. Then, it looks up each word in a dictionary of banana words and replaces it with the corresponding banana word. If a word is not found in the dictionary, it is left unchanged in the translated text.
